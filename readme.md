# Web Crawler

This is just a very simple web crawler. What it does is try to get as many websites as it can.

It will use BFS algorithm to search every link on the website and go to that website and then go to each links on that website. So on and on.

1. Go to the base link
2. Store links on the init website
3. Go to the first link from the table which has not been visited
4. Repeat this process
